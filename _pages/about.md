I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Statistics at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), with a strong interest in macroeconomics, asset pricing, and econometrics. This page includes my `curriculum vitae`, `research`, and `academic resources`.   

I hold a BSc in Statistics and Economics and have worked as a teaching assistant at the Department of Statistics at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), where I assisted in undergraduate courses.
